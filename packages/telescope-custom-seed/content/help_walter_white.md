My dad is amazing. It's funny, but I didn't know that until I found out he was going to die. That it was going to happen soon. That it was real.

Then I thought about a lot of stuff. Things I hadn't thought about for a long time. I guess I kind of took him for granted or something. I mean, our parents are just always there. You expect them to always be bugging you.

What a wonderful dad I have. But he is in trouble.

It's Lung Cancer. He needs an operation. Now!

To help, please send your contribution to our operation fund and keep my Dad in your prayers!
