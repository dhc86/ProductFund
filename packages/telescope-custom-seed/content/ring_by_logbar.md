Ring is like magic, allowing you to control anything you want, by wearing it on your finger. You can send texts, control home appliances, and even pay your bills all at once and in a flash.

Ring only detects the movement of the finger that is inside and identifies the gesture being made. You can perform gestures regardless of time or place. There have been countless studies and development efforts spent on this technology to make the gesture recognition within Ring a reality. We were particularly focused on the improvement of the accuracy of recognition and power saving features, with Ring's development.

Each Application, has its own unique gesture mark, so when you want to use it, simply perform the designated action.

Utilizing Ring's precise letter recognition software (Ring Font), you can type letters anywhere, anytime. Now you can use Twitter, Facebook, or other social network features, send texts, and even change the station on your TV, by performing a simple gesture. Ring is also compatible with Google Glass and smart watches, giving you greater control over how you use it.
