Straight out of the box you can begin capturing and sharing stunning aerial photographs and videos, with absolutely no complex flight training required." - Ivan Reedman, Head of Research and Development.
A plethora of sensors work seamlessly together to allow ZANO to avoid obstacles, hold its position and know exactly where it is in conjunction with your smart device, at all times. 

This means ZANO operates on a virtual tether connected to your smart device. Allowing for simple gesture control of ZANO. Tilt your phone or tablet left or right, forward or backward and ZANO will follow. (ZANO can also be utilised in "Free Flight" mode, using on-screen Joy Sticks). On screen slide bars control rotation and altitude. ZANO will hold its position unless instructed otherwise (In both "Capture" mode as well as "Free Flight" mode), which allows for maximum control and creative freedom without the burden of piloting ZANO.

If ZANO senses it's strayed too far from your smart device or is running low on battery, it will automatically return to your smart device. 

Operating on a virtual tether also enables "Follow me" capability in ZANO. Which means once you set ZANO's hold position, it will register the distance it is from your smart device. You can choose for ZANO to hold this position or enable a "Follow me" feature, which will instruct ZANO to constantly maintain that distance from your smart device and follow you whilst avoiding any obstacles that may get it in the way during flight.
